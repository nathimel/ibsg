distance: squared_dist # squared_dist or abs_dist

# inverse temp params for generating random distributions: lower -> more uniform distribution

# 0 is useless, \infty is perfect; to sweep
# NOTE: these parameters constrain each other; if they are not both low, only high complexity+accuracy langs will emerge.
discriminative_need_beta: 1e2 # for utility in the games
meaning_dist_beta: 1e-1 # for perceptually uncertain meaning dists
