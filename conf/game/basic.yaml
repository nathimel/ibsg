# inverse temp params for generating random distributions: lower -> more uniform distribution

# 0 is useless, \infty is perfect; to sweep
# N.B.: base 10, so -\infty => 0, \infty => \infty

# NOTE: these parameters constrain each other; if they are not both low, only high complexity+accuracy langs will emerge.
