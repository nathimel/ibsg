# game paramters

# States/meanings
universe: 10 
# if positive integer, creates a universe of integers (e.g. 10 => [0-9].) 
# if string, specify the name of a file located at data/universe at the root of this repository.

# Prior / communicative need distribution over states
prior: -8  
# if int, represents a temperature parameter (exponentiated by 10) for an energy-based initialization. int or filename.  #(N.B., dirac deltas causes nans)
# if string, specify the name of a file located at data/prior at the root of this repository.

num_signals: 10

distance: squared_dist # squared_dist or abs_dist

# inverse temp params for generating random distributions: lower -> more uniform distribution

# 0 is useless, \infty is perfect; to sweep

# NOTE: these parameters constrain each other; if they are not both low, only high complexity+accuracy langs will emerge.

# sim-based distribution, sim(x,y) = exp(-gamma * d(x,y)), and 0 => uniform.
discriminative_need_gamma: 1.0 # # will be exponentiated by 10, for utility in the games
meaning_dist_gamma: 0 # will be exponentiated by 10, for perceptually uncertain meaning dists = imprecise imitation in replicator dynamics (Franke and Correia, 2018).

num_processes: 6 # the number of CPU cores to use when parallelizing simulation runs


# IB Curve params
overwrite_curves: False # whether to skip curve estimation
# log-spaced beta for IB curve sweep
# N.B.: the below params are currently ignored (see analysis.ib.betas) in favor of a hard-coded list of values that sufficiently sweep out a curve with few gaps.
maxbeta: 5  # will not be exponentiated
minbeta: -2 # will be exponentiated, i.e. 10 ** minbeta
