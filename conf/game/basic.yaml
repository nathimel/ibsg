# game paramters

# States/meanings
universe: 10 
# if positive integer, creates a universe of integers (e.g. 10 => [0-9].) 
# if string, specify the name of a file located at data/universe at the root of this repository.

# Prior / communicative need distribution over states
prior: 1e-8
# if float, represents an inverse temperature parameter (exponentiated by 10) for an energy-based initialization.  #(N.B., dirac deltas causes nans)
# if string, specify the name of a file located at data/prior at the root of this repository.

num_signals: 10

distance: squared_dist # squared_dist or abs_dist

# inverse temp params for generating random distributions: lower -> more uniform distribution

# 0 is useless, \infty is perfect; to sweep

# NOTE: these parameters constrain each other; if they are not both low, only high complexity+accuracy langs will emerge.

# sim-based distribution, sim(x,y) = exp(-gamma * d(x,y)), and => uniform.
discriminative_need_gamma: 0.5 # for utility in the games, see below

meaning_dist_pi: 0.5 # the multiplier on the Gaussian-likee perceptually uncertain meaning distributions, which should be identified with the imprecision parameter of noise in Franke and Correia, 2018.:
# p(y|x) \propto \exp(-pi * d(x,y))

num_processes: 6 # the number of CPU cores to use when parallelizing simulation runs


# IB Curve params
overwrite_curves: False # whether to skip curve estimation
# log-spaced beta for IB curve sweep
# N.B.: By default, the below params are currently ignored (see analysis.ib.betas) in favor of a hard-coded list of values that sufficiently sweep out a curve with few gaps.
